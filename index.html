<p>I am a <em>part-time</em> Senior Lecturer in the
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at
<a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>.
I am also an Engineering Consultant at
<a href="http://www.bighugegames.com/">Big Huge Games</a>.</p>

<p>My expertise is primarily in systems software, programming languages,
and software engineering.
I work toward efficient, reliable, and secure systems at the intersection
of hardware and software, servers and services.
I am also interested in video game design, computer science education,
and the impact of technology on society.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to know more, feel free to check out
my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/froehlich">LinkedIn profile</a>,
my <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=641486">RateMyProfessor ratings</a>,
or my <a href="https://nilisnotnull.blogspot.com/">infrequently updated blog</a>.
I also have
a <a href="bio/froehlich-abet.pdf">brief ABET-style CV</a>
and a <a href="bio/froehlich-vitae.pdf">full academic CV</a>
to bore you with.
Sadly my <a href="http://phf.rocks/">personal website</a> is currently down, despite
the exceedingly ironic domain name I picked.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>I have been teaching computer science professionally since 2002.
In 2015 I won the
<a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/excellence-teaching-awards/">William H. Huggins <em>Excellence in Teaching</em> Award</a>,
so at least <em>some</em> people seem to think that I know what I am doing.
Below is a list of recent course offerings.</p>

<h3>Fall 2018</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="2018/fall/cs229/">601.229: Computer Systems Fundamentals</a></li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html">Munich University of Applied Sciences</a></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="2018/spring/cs355/">601.355: Video Game Design Project</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>Over the years, I have developed a set of <a href="policies.html">policies</a> that
apply to <em>all</em> courses I teach.
Courses I co-teach with other faculty members often adopt a <em>variation</em>
of these policies, please check the relevant course website or syllabus
for details.</p>

<h2>Colophone</h2>

<p>After years of maintaining a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; home page complete with &ldquo;fancy&rdquo;
styles and layouts I decided to stop caring about such things in January
2017.
Now I just run some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>
through <a href="https://github.com/zserge/zs">zs</a> with a trivial layout file
and that&rsquo;s it.
I highly recommend you do the same.</p>
